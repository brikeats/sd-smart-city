Dashboard for San Diego's CityIQ sensor network.

# Deployment

I'm trying heroku for deployment. I ran `heroku create` to create a project from the command line. Also need to set environmental variable like so: `heroku config:set GOOGLE_MAPS_TOKEN=$GOOGLE_MAPS_TOKEN`. Then deploy with `git push heroku master`.
